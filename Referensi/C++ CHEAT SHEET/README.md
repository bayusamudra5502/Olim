# C++ and Data Structures & Algorithms Cheat Sheet

These are two cheat sheets I put together describing both basic [C++ syntax](C++%20Syntax.md) and many common [data structures and algorithms](Data%20Structures%20and%20Algorithms.md) in C++ for my past interviews at Google, NASA, etc.

Hopefully you find them useful, and please open an issue or submit a PR if you find incorrect or missing information!

**NOTE** This cheat sheet was forked from https://github.com/gibsjose/cpp-cheat-sheet at June 25th, 2019. If you find any problem, you can open issue in original repo.
